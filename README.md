# CESMD

The Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data (CESMD) is a cooperative center established by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the California Geological Survey (CGS) to integrate earthquake strong-motion data from the CGS California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program, the USGS National Strong Motion Project, and the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS). The CESMD provides raw and processed strong-motion data for earthquake engineering applications.
